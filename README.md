## Learning React

#### What are the requirements for the application to be considered Minimum Viable Product(MVP)?

**Client**

Must be written in React
Must utilize custom styling in ALL VIEWS
Your project should not look like the Workout Log or the Pie Client
Add form validation to user signup/login:
An email address should look like ‘test@test.com’,
If a username is used instead of an email address, the username should be at least 4 or more characters and needs to include at least one (1) number or special character.
Password should include 5 or more characters
Must implement react-router
Navbar /sidebar etc...
Must connect with the server’s deployed URL
Must display the functionality of the minimum 8 endpoints in the server
Must be deployed

**User story:**
Sometimes I have trouble deciding what to read next. I would like a website that allows me to search by specific criteria like genre to help me decide what to read. I would also like to be able to store things I am interested in so I can come back and look at that list later. 

### Mission Statement

To allow users to create their own account that allows them to browse and store information on media types such as movies, books, and games.  Users will be able to save a list of media descriptions, ratings, etc.. on their account.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
